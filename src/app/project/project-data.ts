The software allows political campaigns to send 10,000+ text messages within minutes. The sofware was developed in bright and dark mode. This resulated a 40% improvement in the User Experience of the Agent Platform, resulting in increased usability, higher customer satisfaction, a 50% reduction in customer service inquiries, and less reliance on walkthrough guides. During the project I addressed the top 50 highest-priority user experience bugs in the Peerly Agent UI that generated the most customer inquiries. I also Assisted the team in sending over 17 million texts in one day during the 2022 United States Elections with the newly developed Agent Platform.",
